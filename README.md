# Runar
New Haskell-like declarative esoteric programming language, which uses Futhark runes as operators and runic circles as form of code

Â© 21 February 2025 by Igor Voloshin

The manual for the Runar labguage is in development now and will be uploaded here in a while. Above the sample of Runar code is shown, just a simple string search and compare ruotine. Only runes written in bold are operators, the rest are just comments.
Please keep an eye here if you are interested and I will put my efforts to be with the manual as soon as possible. The interpreter of the language is also in development, it is based on the Pyramidion Database system, early versions of which are uploaded in the Ariador/pyramidion repsitory.
